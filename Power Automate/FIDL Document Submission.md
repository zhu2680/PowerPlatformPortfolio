## Overview
This flow is triggered when a user completes a Microsoft form. The information entered in the form is extracted by the flow and write into a list item in the destination sharepoint site for tracking purpose. The attached document in the field is created in a sharepoint library by the flow. This library keeps all the versions and revisions of the document for audit purpose.
